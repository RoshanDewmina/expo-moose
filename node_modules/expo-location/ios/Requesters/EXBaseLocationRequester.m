    // 1. Why do we call CLLocationManager methods by those dynamically created selectors?
    //
    //    Most probably application code submitted to Apple Store is statically analyzed
    //    paying special attention to camelcase(request_always_location) being called on CLLocationManager.
    //    This lets Apple warn developers when it notices that location authorization may be requested
    //    while there is no NSLocationUsageDescription in Info.plist. Since we want to neither
    //    make Expo developers receive this kind of messages nor add our own default usage description,
    //    we try to fool the static analyzer and construct the selector in runtime.
    //    This way behavior of this requester is governed by provided NSLocationUsageDescriptions.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    //
    // 2. Why there's no way to call specifically whenInUse or always authorization?
    //
    //    The requester sets itself as the delegate of the CLLocationManager, so when the user responds
    //    to a permission requesting dialog, manager calls `locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:` method.
    //    To be precise, manager calls this method in two circumstances:
    //      - right when `request*Authorization` method is called,
    //      - when `authorizationStatus` changes.
    //    With this behavior we aren't able to support the following use case:
    //      - app requests `whenInUse` authorization
    //      - user allows `whenInUse` authorization
    //      - `authorizationStatus` changes from `undetermined` to `whenInUse`, callback is called, promise is resolved
    //      - app wants to escalate authorization to `always`
    //      - user selects `whenInUse` authorization (iOS 11+)
    //      - `authorizationStatus` doesn't change, so callback is not called and requester can't know whether
    //        user responded to the dialog selecting `whenInUse` or is still deciding
    //    To support this use case we will have to change the way location authorization is requested
    //    from promise-based to listener-based.

=======
    
    // 2. Location permission request types
    //
    //    Foreground
    //    - "Allow once"
    //    - "Allow while using App"
    //    - "Don't allow"
    //
    //    Background
    //    - "Keep only while using"
    //    - "Change to always allow"
    //
    // Requesting background permissions directly without first asking for foreground permissions is the
    // same as asking for foreground permissions and then asking for background permissions.
    //
    // "Allow once" is a temporary permission (limited to the current app session). It is not possible to get
    // info from the API about wether or not the current permission is temporary. You cannot request background
    // permissions with a temporary token - a background request will then return denied.
    //
    // Requesting background permissions directly and "Allow while using the App" gives you a provisional
    // background permission that can later be elevated to a full "Always allow" permission.
    // You will be asked at a later point if you want to convert to "Always allow". The system waits until
    // you have started using the newly aquired permission before showing the permission dialog.
    //
    // Test the following scenarios in BareExpo -> APIs -> Location
    // ------------------------------------------------------------
    // (before tests, make sure to clear any location permissions and restart the app)
    //
    //   rfp = requestForegroundPermissionsAsync, fp: Actual foreground permission given
    //   rbp = requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync, bg: Actual background permission given
    //
    // - rfp -> "Allow once", then rbp -> no dialog                             = (fp: granted (temporary), bg: denied after 1.5 seconds)
    // - rfp -> "Allow while using App", then rbp -> "Keep only while using"    = (fp: granted, bg: denied)
    // - rfp -> "Allow while using App", then rbp -> "Change to always allow"   = (fp: granted, bg: granted)
    // - rfp -> "Don't allow", then rbp -> no dialog                            = (fp: denied, bg: denied)
    // - rbp -> "Allow once", no more dalogs                                    = (fp: granted (temporary), bg: denied)
    // - rbp -> "Allow while using App", no more dialogs                        = (fp: granted, bg: granted (provisional))
